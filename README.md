# UniqueElementInArray
C++ Program to find Unique element in a Array
in c++, ^ means XOR operation.
whenever we do XOR of a number with itself, the output is 0 (ZERO).
Also, XOR of a number with 0 gives result as the number itself.
that means every number that is present twice will end up being Zero.
and Finally only that number will remain in the answer variable which is present only once, means is UNIQUE.
